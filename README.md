"# ProjektiTestim" 
This is the coding part of a project I had to do in my last year of university. The subject was "Software Testing and Maintenance", We had to test a web application using both manual and automated testing.
The automation testing had to be done using Selenium Webdriver automation tool. I did five test cases that you can find in this repository.
